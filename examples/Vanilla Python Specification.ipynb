    "\"Vanilla Python\" is a \"pseudocode\" intended for teachers to use with new or beginner students, who are encountering text-based programming for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, it is a Python execution context whose language is made more accessible for new programmers to learn some of the basic concepts of computational thinking, algorithms, and data structures. It aims to provide a learning environment to make plain concepts that are often encountered in \"CS 101\" courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation details, it basically can be thought of a streamlined language that is converted into regular, plain Python, and is then executed. In addition to that, however, it also provides some data structures that assist with teaching concepts such as arrays and streams. Moreover, you can write straight Python right next to Vanilla Python, which allows the student to explore more advanced concepts, or for the teacher to write functions that perform calculations or produce output that is beyond the scope of the lesson (so only understanding the signature or doc string is required).\n",
    "\n",
    "This was heavily inspired by the IB Pseudocode and is almost entirely derived from it, with modifications. The major contribution here is that we can actually practice and execute this \"pseudocode,\" along with regular Python. In addition, how this language works is made plain and specified with sound behaviour and choices made explicit. Furthermore, error checking with the both variants produced, as well as some very minor changes made to the language itself, for convenience reasons.\n",

    "One of the key motivations was to provide my students an execution enviornment for the IB Computer Science pseudocode portion of the course.\n",
